# StemViz

This is a collection of code that lets you write music visualization based on
each individual part of the music. Instead of trying to recover visualization
signals from the end-product audio file, you can export your project as stems
and use each stem as a separate source in your visualization code.

## Dependencies

- The `ffmpeg` utility.
- `npm install canvas wavefile leftpad`
